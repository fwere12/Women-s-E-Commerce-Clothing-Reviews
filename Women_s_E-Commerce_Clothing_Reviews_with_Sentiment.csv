5;847;47;Flattering shirt;This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!!;5.0;1;6;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

11;1077;53;Dress looks like it's made of cheap material;Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.;3.0;0;14;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;neutral;negative;0;-1

15;1077;50;Pretty party dress with some issues;This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip;3.0;1;1;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

27;949;33;Huge disappointment;I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh;2.0;0;0;General;Tops;Sweaters;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

75;1081;59;I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear;5;1.0;1;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

108;836;66;Beautiful;I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.;4.0;1;0;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

359;862;34;Almost but not quite;This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.;3.0;0;0;General Petite;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;neutral;negative;0;-1

3394;860;55;Love the design;Although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well. i downsized two sizes and it still didn't hang well on my body. i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person. i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it.;3.0;0;0;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;neutral;positive;0;1

3407;1092;39;Cutesy;Cute and perhaps a little too innocent for my age because the petite was too high and wide on me.  fits great on my shoulders/chest and the flare can be controlled with a layer and belt.  i already have a few ivory lace dresses that look age appropriate first try.  i don't think i have the right personality for this one.  looks great on everyone else i've seen wearing it!;4.0;1;0;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

4065;895;61;Comfy cute;I bought this in the reddish color. i was a little skeptical that the fit or style would really work on a petite person but it looks great on. the fabric is very soft but with enough body that the cowl keeps it's shape. i predict that people will get tired of seeing me in this as i'm going to wear it a lot.;5.0;1;1;General Petite;Tops;Fine gauge;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

4079;907;57;Love it but.....;Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.;3.0;1;0;General;Tops;Fine gauge;;;;;;;;;neutral;positive;0;1
4080;1056;38;A change from the average chino;The teal color is beautiful. the fit is wide leg with a low waist. i have been wearing so many high waist pieces lately they felt really low. the material is really soft. they fit tts.;4.0;1;0;General Petite;Bottoms;Pants;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1
4084;895;32;Deliciously soft;This sweater is gorgeous. ordered in the grey motif. was as described and wonderfully soft. i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all. i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs. looking forward to the colder months!;5.0;1;0;General Petite;Tops;Fine gauge;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
4085;863;50;Nice long sleeves! runs small!;This sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy. i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl! this runs very small.;3.0;1;3;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;positive;neutral;1;0

4128;1094;49;Material not as expected;This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.;3.0;0;11;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

4143;1104;47;Adorable fit;This dress is a lovely fit. the knit top accentuates the bust and the loose skirt below the empire waist just skims the figure. it's pretty casual and the skirt is a tiny bit sheer so better for weekends than for office wear.;4.0;1;1;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
4146;1104;66;"Synthetic fabric evokes ""cheap"" quality";I love the style the lightness and the fit ... but the fabric in the skirt just did not meet my expectations. this might be something to find at a mass retailer. i guess i simply prefer a natural fabric.;4.0;0;1;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

4253;1086;66;Not for me;Took another reviewer's advice and sized up to an xl. unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasn't attractive. love the color. and it's dreamy soft. the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms. my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy (it clings) and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large. sadly returned.;3.0;1;2;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;neutral;negative;0;-1

4549;829;51;Not for me;The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.;3.0;0;1;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;neutral;negative;0;-1

5122;823;66;Nope;There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.;1.0;0;0;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;neutral;negative;0;-1

6939;1084;33;Unflattering;I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.;1.0;0;10;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

6954;68;49;Exactly what i was missing from my wardrobe;I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.;5.0;1;0;Initmates;Intimate;Layering;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

6968;663;39;The material is lightweight and comfortable.;The only draw back are the slits on the side. they are too high and if you turn sideways at some angles you can see your cheeks. i will have them sewn up a bit because i love the dress and it is worth it.;4.0;1;0;Initmates;Intimate;Lounge;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1
6969;970;47;Super soft but fits boxy and fits small;I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.;2.0;0;3;General;Jackets;Jackets;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

6987;719;34;Love it more than i thought;I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.;5.0;1;0;Initmates;Intimate;Lounge;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

7015;1094;47;Nice but not for me;Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it's just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.;3.0;1;0;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
7018;1094;27;Gorgeous dress!;This is a beautiful dress. the embroidery is really lovely in person. i find that this brand runs a bit small usually. i am usually an 8 but had to go up to a 10 to fit my hips. i am a little bit pear shaped so that might be why.;5.0;1;0;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
7020;1078;50;Cute;Dress is actually very cute - i like it better in person than online. the color is a very pretty deep denim blue color. it is cut very roomy/swingy. length is a bit too long in the back for my taste but still like the way it flows. i am very slight of frame and on me there is a lot of extra material but nothing a good tailor can't fix in a jiffy. perfect for a summer day/bbq or casual party.;4.0;1;0;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

7097;850;56;Pretty hot mess;This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.;2.0;0;3;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

7105;645;65;Fabulous tank;I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!;5.0;1;4;Initmates;Intimate;Intimates;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

7129;984;48;Very impressed;What a great jacket. love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue. i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand. i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa. thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture. very happy with my purchase.;5.0;1;0;General Petite;Jackets;Jackets;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

7136;984;52;Polished look;Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it doesn't appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.;5.0;1;11;General Petite;Jackets;Jackets;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

7141;891;27;**great for broad shouldered women**;"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!";5.0;1;0;General;Tops;Fine gauge;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

7165;863;20;I tried this on in store in a small and then ordered the medium online i loved it so much! i generally run a small/medium with retailer so i thought this was pretty true to size. i'm also longer through the torso so the medium is better for me to cover my stomach when tied.  it is on the thinner side but not see through. perfect for layering and for a mild california winter. can't wait for it to come!;5;1.0;0;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

7325;766;66;Surprise;I'd hoped these would be cozy and warm. the fabric is thin and slinky. it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll. couldn't wait to get them off. just horrible. and that price is very steep. can't recommend.;3.0;0;0;Initmates;Intimate;Lounge;;;;;;;;;negative;positive;-1;1

7349;1030;44;Terrible cut;These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90's that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...;2.0;1;4;General;Bottoms;Jeans;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

7354;1077;46;Weird fit;Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all;2.0;0;0;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

7399;1100;59;Great drapey fabric;I loved the fabric and this print but it was just cut a little wrong for me. the gathering on the side made me look a bit wide. but the fabric is beautiful and everything else was nice. i did like the fact that it ties in the back so you can slim down the sillouhette (sp?) if you want to.;4.0;1;1;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

7471;907;64;Great;What a nice sweater! i just received this in the gray and i think it is one of the most flattering sweaters i've gotten in a long time. the fit is true to size. the sleeves are very long and tight halfway to the elbows and fit well in the upper arms. the stitching on the body gives an illusion of height and is slenderizing. the weight is perfect for every season. i am very happy with everything about this sweater.;5.0;1;0;General Petite;Tops;Fine gauge;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

7601;820;48;Casual elegance!;I am so glad i purchased this top and read the reviews thoroughly. i am usually a 10 or medium in tops because of my broad shoulders (for reference 5'9 145 lbs and athletic build). i decided to size down to an 8. the top fits perfect and looks just as pictured. it is a bit more substantial then i expected. the details and embroidery are beautiful and make this top so uniquely retailer! it is casual in an elegant way. i will be pairing this with skinny jeans and/or white skinny pants. i cannot tell;4.0;1;0;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
7602;815;52;It's huge!;This is a beautiful blouse but it's gigantic. my bra size is 34d and i was swimming in a 2. the bust measured 42 inches at it's widest point. you can see the model is camouflaging the volume by holding her arms to the side. the fabric is pulled in an unatural way so the top is probably pinned for the photo. if you want this look go down 2 sizes. that much fabric is just not flattering on me so i am returning to the store. i'm passing on the 0 because the thin fabric seems like it will seriously;4.0;1;10;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

7651;1072;39;Nice dress;For reference i am 5'3 121 lbs and i usually wear a size 6 or 8. i got a size small and it was still at bit large. my bf said it was a nice dress to wear around the house ( like a house dress). a bit pricey for that but the way it hangs it does look like a house dress or a bit like a sack. i kept it only because i was looking for casual dresses. i wore it out and got a few compliments ( prob cuz i never wear dresses). good luck.;4.0;1;0;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
7653;1072;25;Gorgeous detail;"I fell in love with this dress as soon as i came across it online. ordered the dress in a large and it fit perfectly. i'm smaller on top and larger at the bottom (pear shaped). the dress fit well and hid all of my ""flaws"". only problem was that it wrinkled very easily and im wondering if i received a dress that was sitting around for awhile since it was covered with lint and white fuzz when i received it in the mail. other than that the design was absolutely beautiful with incredible embroidery.";4.0;1;0;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

7660;824;49;Runs large;"Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!";3.0;0;4;General Petite;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;neutral;1;0

7721;936;54;Cute but poorly made;Weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel. needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing. not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash.;2.0;0;21;General;Tops;Sweaters;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

9203;1074;63;Essential spring dress;I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect. the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online. the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for spring/summer weather. i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration. i am normally a size 8 in dresses and found this to fit very true to size.;5.0;1;0;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

9285;927;38;Pretty and soft;I'm very happy with this sweater--it's very soft to the touch and comfortable to wear. i have the pink version and find the shimmer on the waist and arms to be a nice touch. the only concern i have for this is that it feels like it stretches out a bit easily. by the end of the day the arms feel a bit baggy.;4.0;1;2;General Petite;Tops;Sweaters;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
9286;1072;51;Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.;2;0.0;10;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

10472;873;34;The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.;1;0.0;3;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1
10475;1035;42;Nice but a little skinny;I probably have 10 pairs of pilcro jeans and pants and most of the jeans are the skinny fit. i wanted something that wasn't a skinny fit so i thought i would try these straight fit jeans thinking they would be skinny but they also wouldn't be loose. just got them today and when i tried them on they were tighter then the skinny jeans i just took off. i guess i agree with the other reviewers that they fit like a glove. so if that's what you're looking for these will be great.;4.0;1;0;General Petite;Bottoms;Jeans;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

11298;1096;36;Only for no chested women;This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.;2.0;0;3;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

13051;1037;46;Great pants;"I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it ""runs small"" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!";5.0;1;0;General Petite;Bottoms;Jeans;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

13075;1020;50;Lining too short;I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer;3.0;0;1;General;Bottoms;Skirts;;;;;;;;;neutral;negative;0;-1

13107;1020;57;The material is beautiful and as others said its a bit fuller than one might think. i am returning because it's high waisted with a thick elastic waist band. not my style - i suppose it would work with a thick belt. as i said its beautiful - just not my style.;3;1.0;0;General;Bottoms;Skirts;;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1
13110;1094;36;Great price for a cute dress;I was a little hesitant about sizing based on reviews-but my normal small fit perfectly. it is a little low cut for work-but with a scarf will be fine. i wish it was a bit shorter (hits just below the knees on me).but overall great. i have a fairly straight body type and think dress probably works best on this type. although if you were small on top and curvy on bottom i think this could be cute too. for the price point (with the sale) its definitely worth trying! i got the black and white-and i;5.0;1;0;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

13417;1094;40;Very cute!;I tried this dress on today and ended up buying it. its a thicker material and looks better in person. more red and white striped with an uneven hem. the back of the dress is a bit more like a swim suit. i probably is best for smaller chests. i'm guessing it runs a little bit big - as the medium fit nicely on me and lately i'm a large medium/small large.;5.0;1;4;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

14595;850;39;Wrong button choice;I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that;1.0;0;3;General Petite;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

14739;1095;41;Don't buy this dress!! blue stained my dress!;On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.;1.0;0;0;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1
14743;1095;24;Lovely but not for me;This dress is adorable but sadly not for me. i had to size up from my normal 6/8 to a 10 regular to make sure all my curves fit in comfortably. sadly i wasn't in love. the bow back hit me right to cover my bra but the fact mine didn't come with pockets as shown was a disappointment. it will be going back.;4.0;1;0;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

14822;868;53;Cute spring/summer top;I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me. i wasn't expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer (34d-27-35) and it fits perfectly. the material is a touch thin but that's okay with me since i don't want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway. i also don't find this top particularly see through as it's black and will wear a full coverage bra wit;5.0;1;17;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

14830;1110;51;Very flattering;I am 5'4 and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length. i got a size 14 which is my typical size. the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders. it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped - is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute it's worth it. great dress for transitioning in;5.0;1;1;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

14943;828;58;Perfect in every way;Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.;5.0;1;28;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

15073;750;47;Perfect little affordable dress;This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat;5.0;1;1;Initmates;Intimate;Swim;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

15092;872;46;I bought this top in white. i wore it with black skinny crop jeans. it is very cute and flattering. the length is just so that it makes the swing top flattering without is bring too overwhelming. i received lots of compliments. the quality is great and the top washed up well too. love it. for reference. i'm 5'5' 125 lbs and bought the top in small.;5;1.0;14;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1
15095;1049;34;Interesting pant!;I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-12 and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!;4.0;1;0;General Petite;Bottoms;Pants;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

15102;1025;56;Love these!!;Every so often the perfect pair of bottoms comes along. this style was it for me. i'm tall 5'9 so the length fits perfect for a crop wide leg trouser. i will be able to wear these in the summer as they are light weight enough and also into fall before it gets too cold. can't wait to wear them. extra bonus i got them on sale. if you are short these will probably be more like a long leg trouser on you. also fit true to size.;5.0;1;0;General;Bottoms;Jeans;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

15113;996;66;Very flattering;"Ordered in my normal size large and i love it. beautiful fit. striking pattern that's quite slimming. the stripes are deep chocolate next to a mauve purple gray on a white background. it looks black so lots of colors would work on top. the fabrication is a soft rib knit and it has a substantial elastic waistband. it overlaps in the front and the opening falls a bit  high so that may be a deal breaker for some because it does expose some upper thigh. i like the look but i'm 5'3"" so it works well";5.0;1;4;General Petite;Bottoms;Skirts;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

15155;940;56;Must have piece for fall;First saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price. i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular. the length hits right below my bum so it's perfectly structured to wear with leggings. the cable knit is super soft and very warm. wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago. this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price.;5.0;1;2;General;Tops;Sweaters;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

15173;1035;42;Hip & trendy;This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.;5.0;1;0;General;Bottoms;Jeans;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
15174;1080;62;Comfortable dress;I really like this dress a lot. the material is soft and comfortable. it is clingy but not in a bad way. the design can camouflage some figure problems. i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great. can't say enough about how comfortable this dress is.;5.0;1;2;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

16909;984;25;Cropped fit;The jacket was nice and soft but it was too short on my torso with a cropped fit which i'm not a fan of that style. i returned it.;3.0;0;0;General;Jackets;Jackets;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

16939;984;25;Just wonderful!!;This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.;5.0;1;0;General;Jackets;Jackets;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

16944;984;68;Great jacket!;"I recently purchased this jacket online in the rose color and it is beautiful! i usually wear an xs in retailer but purchased this in size s after trying on the grey color at the store. there was no xs to try for comparison but the s fit well and leaves room for light layers underneath. the only reason i rated it as ""runs small"" is that xs is my usual size so this may be true to size for most. i also wanted the option of zipping with layers underneath. the sleeves are long but can be rolled";5.0;1;0;General;Jackets;Jackets;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
16945;1095;24;This is a trial and error dress;This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love;3.0;1;0;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1
16951;1095;40;Pretty but not quite right;This dress is really simple and elegant and i want to love it but i'm having a hard time getting it to fit right. i'm normally a size 4/6 and i bought this in an 8 and couldn't zip it up. i'm a 36d which is part of the problem so i exchanged it for a 10 and i can now zip it but the bar in the back i thought would cover my bra strap but like other reviewers mentioned its a bit high. most of my bras fall right into the hole beneath the bar. its unfortunate because i wanted to love this dress. i mi;4.0;1;1;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

17041;1110;54;Beautiful color!;This dress is a beautiful color and is so lightweight and flowing. will be perfect for a fall wedding that i am attending. it is supposed to be loose so i think it is relatively true to size if not just a bit on the large side. will look great with a kimono or other wrap when the weather is a bit chilly.;5.0;1;2;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

18332;1092;47;I tried this dress on in hawaii before it even hit the website. i am guessing retailer tests out their spring line in always summer hawaii. i was impressed but wanted to wait for a promo. there is a lining that fluffs up the skirt part of dress and makes it fun and girly. i sized up to 4p from my usual 2p in holding horses due to the tailored upper part of the dress and my shoulders a wee bit wide.;4;1.0;19;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

18744;1077;24;Careful curvy girls!!!!;So after ordering this dress and trying it on myself i was able to make sense of the previous reviews. this dress is constructed very oddly. the top seems to have no room for any hips. it is a straight construct so if you are like me that has an hourglass shape but has a pair of hips i would size up. i bought this in a 6p and in all colors. first off the colors/ patterns are amazing in person very adorable. this fit my 34ddd bust without any problems and no problems in torso either. it was reall;4.0;1;2;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

18769;868;39;Eek!;Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.;1.0;0;4;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

18776;868;60;Weird;The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.;3.0;0;1;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

18897;829;50;Revealing;This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.;3.0;0;0;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;neutral;negative;0;-1

20729;1059;23;More than a legging;These are as comfortable as any other leggings. they are thick enough that they are not see through (such a pet peeve when i see people with see through leggings). the front panel is so soft and i feel like it gives more of a professional vibe. they are a bit cropped/short but i'm tall so i'm used to this.;5.0;1;1;General Petite;Bottoms;Pants;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
20731;883;59;Wanted to love it;This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.;4.0;1;26;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

20755;1037;29;Runs small;The front of these is the leather looking material. the back is just a stretchy material. they are comfortable but they run very small. i consistently wear a 27 in this brand. i purchased that size but could barely get them up. definitely size up. i had to exchange. they are cute but i'm not sure they are worth full price. the quality is mediocre and i think you can buy faux leather pants for less at another store.;4.0;1;1;General Petite;Bottoms;Jeans;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
20757;883;26;I like the feel of the fabric but...;It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didn't work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't. also wrinkles easily.;3.0;0;0;General;Tops;Knits;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

20769;1094;53;Sizing is odd;I love the look of this dress on the hanger in the store and in the pics on the model. but i purchased my usual size 0 in petite ( i am 5 ft 2 in.). it was very form fitting-too much for me- and had little gaps near the waist that i attributed to it being tight the hips. i exchanged it for a 2 petite and that was too large and gaped in the top and waist. for reference my measurements are 32-26-35. so i am going to deduce from my experience and the other reviews that this dress might be best sizi;4.0;1;5;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

20780;1094;51;Wanted to love;This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.;3.0;0;3;General;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;positive;negative;1;-1

21006;895;50;Favorite sweater this season;"I got this in navy and love it. the overall shape is sleek and classic - body skimming but not tight - with subtle detail in the knit design that make it entirely unique. the quality and weight of the cashmere is perfect - not to heavy or light. xs fit perfect on my 5'5"" petite frame. but busty or longer-torsoed people may find the length a bit short - it hits me right at the top of regular low-rise jeans. this may be my favorite retailer buy of the season.";5.0;1;11;General Petite;Tops;Fine gauge;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
21007;912;53;Love it sadly has to go back;This sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer. the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since it's not see through i really like it. the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong size..ordered a small (i checked my order) and i got a xs petite. so sad since large is the only size left.;5.0;1;0;General;Tops;Fine gauge;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

22482;948;50;Truly unique sweater;Loved this sweater when i saw it online. when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured. despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell. the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside. it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell. hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi. it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy. i;5.0;1;0;General;Tops;Sweaters;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

23307;823;30;Great transitional top;This is a perfect late summer into fall top! you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeans/booties for the fall. it's slightly on the roomy side (i am usually a medium and i had room) but i think that's just the structure of the shirt. off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place!;5.0;1;8;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1

23334;1110;41;I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews either. the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her. the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves. maybe i am of an age where i don't always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves. i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes;5;1.0;4;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses;;;;;;;;;;negative;negative;-1;-1

23362;834;46;Cute;I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.;4.0;1;5;General;Tops;Blouses;;;;;;;;;positive;positive;1;1
